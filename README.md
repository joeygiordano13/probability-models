_9.4.1 Markov Processes_

Problem 6

- At each discrete instant of time, measured in minutes, a molecule is either inside a cell membrane, or outside. If it is inside the cell, it has probability 0.2 of passing outside, and if it is outside it has probability 0.1 of entering the cell.
    - If it is inside the cell initially, what is the probability that the molecule is inside the cell at time ***t***? Over the long run, what is the probability that it is inside the cell?
    - If there are 100 molecules inside the cell initially, what is the probability that there are exactly 80 of the molecules remaining in the cell after 1 minute? What is the probability that there are 10 or fewer molecules in the cell after 20 minutes? If N<sub>t</sub> is the ***RV*** representing the number of molecules in the cell at time ***t***, plot the probability mass function for N<sub>20</sub>.

_9.4.2 Random Walks_

Problem 6

- Computer program that simulates a random walk on the integers, with X<sub>0</sub> = 0 and ***p*** = 0.5. Sketch three realizations on the same set of axes.
